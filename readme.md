Transforming sports performance through AI Co-pilot helping students and coaches progress towards identified skill goals. 

This is a deep learning based sports coaching assistant. It aims to help students and coaches in identification of issues and tracking their progress towards identified goals. 
Our initial focus is on fencing, running it for a) en guard position b) gait analysis and c) the motion of advancing. Based on the videos, AI models will auto-generate scores 
for the position under evaluation that can be reviewed by the coach (hence co-pilot mode) for further action.

Phase 1: Given any frame, identify fencing as a sport
Phase 2: For a video identify the enguard position
Phase 3: Do gait analysis of enguard position
Phase 4: Do gait analysis of multiple fencers at once
Phase 5: Do gait analysis on a fencing drill video
Phase 6: Plug in to a live video stream and do real time gait analysis
Phase 7: Identify advance action in a live frame
Phase 8: Identify fencers engaging in a live frame
Phase 9: Identify frames of action in a live video
Phase 10 : Do analysis of major fencing actions. Project will be expanded once we reach here.
